Mandelbrot Set

# Explanation:
The Mandelbrot Set is a famous mathematical set of points that creates a complex, self-repeating, and intricate shape when plotted on a graph. It’s named after Benoît B. Mandelbrot, a mathematician who studied it in the 1970s. 

z<sub>n+1</sub> = z<sup>2</sup>  + c

Steps:

1. Z is a complex number starting from 0
1. C is a point on the imaginary plane like   1 + 1i
1. We square z and add the selected point
1. Then we make the answer our new Z
1. If the series diverges C is not in the Mandelbrot set, if it converges, it is
# Uses:
1\. Newton's Fractal
The Mandelbrot set is essential in visualizing the behavior of Newton's method for finding roots of complex polynomials. Newton’s method is an iterative process used for finding approximate solutions to equations. When applied to a complex polynomial, Newton's method generates fractals, which are visualized by the Mandelbrot set. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set reveals where the roots of the polynomial become stable. This concept is pivotal in numerical analysis and has real-world applications in chemical reaction modeling and quantum physics for studying equilibrium states.

2\. Complex Dynamics and Stability Analysis
The Mandelbrot set offers insights into the stability of systems in complex dynamics. The set helps mathematicians understand the behavior of dynamical systems, especially those governed by iterative processes. The structure of the Mandelbrot set highlights regions of stability and chaos in mathematical systems. This is particularly useful in control theory and signal processing, where stability is critical for designing systems that behave predictably over time.

3\.** Antenna Design
Fractal antennas use the principles of self-similarity to design compact yet efficient antennas. These antennas are especially useful in mobile devices and wireless communication systems, as they provide a wide bandwidth and can operate at multiple frequencies without increasing the physical size of the antenna. By designing antennas with fractal shapes, engineers can create more efficient and smaller devices, making them crucial for cell phones, radar systems, and satellite communications.

## 4\. Medical Predection/Modification
Fractal geometry is used to analyze irregular patterns found in biological structures. For instance, in angiogenesis, where the growth of blood vessels resembles fractal structures. These self-similarity properties can be seen on many levels and can be used to predict behaviors of cells like cancer or indicate developmental irregularities in fetus or experimentally modified evolutionary testing organisms for genetic mutation and adaption in laboratories.
